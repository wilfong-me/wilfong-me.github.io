The intention of techslinger.com is to create a virtual space for
those modern ronin of the technology industry, the techslingers, to
call their own. For now, we are only providing a domain name for email
and personal web pages, but eventually we may provide tools,
information, and the like for the techslinger. It is also possible
this may eventually become a place where those in need of a
techslinger can find one to hire. If you find the concept interesting,
want to contribute, would like to learn more, want an @techslinger.com
address of your own, or need to hire a techslinger, send us an email.
